## Library-System ðŸ“šðŸ’»
Developed by Aditya Bhanwadiya

## Overview
The Library-System is a C++-based library management software designed to enhance efficiency by optimizing book searches using advanced algorithms and data structures. This project was developed as part of the Computer Science second-year Software Engineering and Management course.

The system provides a fast and efficient way to manage book titles, leveraging optimized search techniques and well-structured data management methodologies. Additionally, detailed reports analyze the efficiency of different data structures and algorithms used in the system.

## Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before running the Library-System, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
A suitable development environment (VS Code, CLion, Code::Blocks, or Terminal-based setup)
Make utility installed (for compiling via Makefile)

## Technologies Used
- A **C++ compiler** (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)  
- A suitable **development environment** (VS Code, CLion, Code::Blocks, or Terminal-based setup)  
- **Make** utility installed (for compiling via Makefile)  

## Acknowledgments
A special thanks to everyone who contributed, tested, and provided feedback to improve this project.

Let's continue building efficient and scalable library management software using C++ and advanced algorithms! ðŸš€
